This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation without proper error handling, leading to runtime exceptions.  The function `unsafeHead` retrieves the first element of a list without checking for emptiness. If the list is empty, this will cause a runtime error. 

```haskell
unsafeHead :: [a] -> a
unsafeHead xs = head xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  let result = unsafeHead emptyList  -- This line will crash!
  print result
```
